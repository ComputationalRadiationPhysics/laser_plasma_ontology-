The first version of [laser-plasma ontology](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/laser_plasma_ontology/blob/master/laser-plasma_ontology.rdf) is provided by [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/)  which is one of the most famous and well-established software for ontology creation. The ontology is saved in **RDF/XML** format which is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard for representing RDF (Resource Description Framework) data and is widely adopted in the semantic web community. It is a standard model for representing data and metadata on the web. RDF provides a framework for expressing relationships between resources in a machine-readable format, enabling data interchange and integration across different applications and systems.  
To update/edit the ontology you first need to install Protégé on your system. Then open the app and on the top menu select: _File-> open_ and select the rdf file. Here you can find a short documentary [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=LQ4iW3PO36E&t=660s) on how to add new _Classes_, _Object properties_, and _Data properties_ to the ontology.  
One can also save the ontology in **JSON-LD** (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) format. It allows data to be interconnected and linked across domains by using URIs.  It is commonly used in semantic web applications, including ontologies because it is simple and compatible with web standards and provides context to data through schemas or ontologies, making it machine-readable and interoperable. To save a .rdf file in a JSON-LD format, on the top menu of the Protégé select _File-> Save as->_, and instead of RDF/XML format choose JSON-LD format.  
To **visualize** the ontology, after loading the .rdf file in the Protégé app, from the top menu select _Window-> Tabs_ -> and select _OWLViz_ or _OntoGraf_.  Here you can find a short documentary [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nC2GDnfbnU) on how to use these features. OWLGrEd is also another software that is easy to understand and can be used even with "non-ontologists" to view the structure of ontology online in a web browser without specific expertise. We need to upload the ontology where OWLGrEd will present the structure of the ontology.
